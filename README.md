# Student-Management-Application
This repository contains a Student Management Application built in C++. I built it with other teammates I collobrated with as part of a school project.

## Application Summary
The Application was designed for users (ideally admin or faculty) who manage student rosters and course information for education institution. The application is designed to streamline the data entry process and reduce the tedious process of managing a list of students through traditional record keeping.
The user(s) of the Student Management Application will be allowed to keep track of a list of students and their course load for their entire academic tenure. The user was also be allowed to add, deleted and update a students information 
and they could also do the same thing for a student's courses.

## Programming Languages 
We exclusively used C++ to build the program.

## Programming methodologies
Our team used Object Orientated Programming paradigm to design the application.

## Technologies Used
* Visual Studio Code 
* Repl.it 
* Google Slides(to create high level views)
