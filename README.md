# Student-Management-Application
This project is a Student Management Application built in C++. I built it with classmates that I collobrated with as part of a school project.

The Student Management System is designed to streamline the data entry process and reduce the tedious process of managing a list of students through traditional record keeping methods.
The user(s) of the Student Management System will be allowed to keep track of a list of students and their course load for their entire academic tenure. The user was also be allowed to add, delete and update a students information and could also do the same thing for a student's courses.

## Programming methodologies
* Our team used Object Orientated Programming paradigm to design the application.

## Technologies Used
